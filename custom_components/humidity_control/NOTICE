  - Added three operating modes: idle, wet (humidifying), dry (dehumidifying)
  - Support for separate output entities for wet and dry operations
  - Support for boolean entities (input_boolean) and switches as outputs
  - Modified control logic to handle both humidifying and dehumidifying
  - Removed device_class based single-direction logic
  - Added mode-based action reporting (HUMIDIFYING, DRYING, IDLE)
